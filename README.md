# Violent Crimes in India: State-Level Cluster Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of violent crimes in India at the state level, focusing on the factors and connections between independent variables and violent crimes. The study utilizes various clustering techniques such as K-means, Hierarchical, Gaussian mixture, and Affinity propagation to understand the complex dynamics of violent crimes across different states in India.

## Project Overview

The project aims to analyze the relationship between violent crimes and various independent variables such as poverty rate, literacy rate, sex ratio, human development index, unemployment rate, police personnel per lakh of population, NSDP, head count ratio, and population density. By employing state-of-the-art clustering methods, the study provides insights into the patterns and correlations of violent crimes across different states in India.
